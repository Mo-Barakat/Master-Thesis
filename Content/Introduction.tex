Robotics has always been a cutting-edge field that combines sophisticated engineering, artificial intelligence, and a comprehension of human-environment interactions.
This study is motivated by multiple important elements, all of which highlight the importance and relevance of the research.
This research is motivated by the aim to contribute to the development of robotics, address some of the current knowledge gaps in the field, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.
This research aims to contribute to the field of robotics by developing a multi-legged robotic system.
The focus is on improving movement capabilities and control strategies, with the hope of offering valuable insights into robotic design and functionality.
Even with significant advancements, there are still many unanswered questions about robotic control and locomotion, particularly in systems that replicate biological structures and processes.
Complex dynamic tasks that living beings handle with ease are sometimes difficult for traditional robotic systems to accomplish. This research aims to close these gaps by concentrating on a multi-legged robot that finds inspiration in the natural environment. This will provide insights into more realistic and effective movement tactics. The applications of such advanced robotic systems are vast and varied, ranging from search and rescue operations in hazardous environments to assistive technology in warehouse automation.By pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible in robotic design and control, this research has the potential to make contributions to fields where human intervention is limited, dangerous, or impractical. This project is inherently interdisciplinary, integrating concepts from mechanical engineering, computer science, control theory, and even biology. Such cross-disciplinary collaboration is crucial for driving innovation, as it allows for the exchange of ideas and methods from diverse fields. This approach is expected to yield novel solutions and advancements that could extend well beyond the scope of this project.

%\textbf{Advancements in Robotic Technologies:}% Robotics has grown at an exponential rate over the past few decades, resulting in improved capabilities and more applications. Previously limited to industrial settings, robots are now being deployed in increasingly dynamic and unpredictable circumstances.
