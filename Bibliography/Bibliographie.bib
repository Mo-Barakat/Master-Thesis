% Examples for transfer learning for convolutional neural networs

@article{Shin.2016,
 abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.},

@article{Han.2018,
 abstract = {We tested the use of a deep learning algorithm to classify the clinical images of 12 skin diseases-basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, intraepithelial carcinoma, actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratosis, malignant melanoma, melanocytic nevus, lentigo, pyogenic granuloma, hemangioma, dermatofibroma, and wart. The convolutional neural network (Microsoft ResNet-152 model; Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China) was fine-tuned with images from the training portion of the Asan dataset, MED-NODE dataset, and atlas site images (19,398 images in total). The trained model was validated with the testing portion of the Asan, Hallym and Edinburgh datasets. With the Asan dataset, the area under the curve for the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, intraepithelial carcinoma, and melanoma was 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, 0.83 $\pm$ 0.01, 0.82 $\pm$ 0.02, and 0.96 $\pm$ 0.00, respectively. With the Edinburgh dataset, the area under the curve for the corresponding diseases was 0.90 $\pm$ 0.01, 0.91 $\pm$ 0.01, 0.83 $\pm$ 0.01, and 0.88 $\pm$ 0.01, respectively. With the Hallym dataset, the sensitivity for basal cell carcinoma diagnosis was 87.1{\%} $\pm$ 6.0{\%}. The tested algorithm performance with 480 Asan and Edinburgh images was comparable to that of 16 dermatologists. To improve the performance of convolutional neural network, additional images with a broader range of ages and ethnicities should be collected.},

 abstract = {Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

We consider a constrained nonlinear dynamical system and assume the availability of state-input pair datasets which solve a task T1. Our objective is to find a feasible model predictive control policy for a second task, T2, using stored data from T1. Our approach applies to tasks T2 which are composed of subtasks contained in T1. In this paper we propose a formal definition of subtasks and the task decomposition problem, and provide proofs of feasibility and iteration cost improvement over simple initializations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on autonomous racing and robotic manipulation experiments.},

@misc{Christiano.2016,
 abstract = {Developing control policies in simulation is often more practical and safer than directly running experiments in the real world. This applies to policies obtained from planning and optimization, and even more so to policies obtained from reinforcement learning, which is often very data demanding. However, a policy that succeeds in simulation often doesn't work when deployed on a real robot. Nevertheless, often the overall gist of what the policy does in simulation remains valid in the real world. In this paper we investigate such settings, where the sequence of states traversed in simulation remains reasonable for the real world, even if the details of the controls are not, as could be the case when the key differences lie in detailed friction, contact, mass and geometry properties. During execution, at each time step our approach computes what the simulation-based control policy would do, but then, rather than executing these controls on the real robot, our approach computes what the simulation expects the resulting next state(s) will be, and then relies on a learned deep inverse dynamics model to decide which real-world action is most suitable to achieve those next states. Deep models are only as good as their training data, and we also propose an approach for data collection to (incrementally) learn the deep inverse dynamics model. Our experiments shows our approach compares favorably with various baselines that have been developed for dealing with simulation to real world model discrepancy, including output error control and Gaussian dynamics adaptation.},

@article{Zhao.2020,
 abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has recently seen huge success across multiple areas in the robotics domain. Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed towards closing this sim-to-real gap and accomplish more efficient policy transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application scenarios. Finally, we discuss the main opportunities and challenges of the different approaches and point to the most promising directions.},

 abstract = {A simplified TL scenario is studied to understand how the quality of an alignment-based transfer of data varies with the parameters of two linear, time-invariant (LTI), single-input, single-output systems that are tasked to follow the same reference signal. A scalar, LTI transformation is used to align the output from a source system to the output from a target system. An upper bound on the 2-norm of the transformation error is derived and minimized with respect to the transformation scalar. This minimized bound is analyzed with respect to the system parameters to show when TL works best. TL is further studied for wheeled robots, with data from simulation and experiment to supplement theoretical analysis.},

@misc{Sorocky.2020,
 abstract = {In the robotics literature, experience transfer has been proposed in different learning-based control frameworks to minimize the costs and risks associated with training robots. While various works have shown the feasibility of transferring prior experience from a source robot to improve or accelerate the learning of a target robot, there are usually no guarantees that experience transfer improves the performance of the target robot. In practice, the efficacy of transferring experience is often not known until it is tested on physical robots. This trial-and-error approach can be extremely unsafe and inefficient. Building on our previous work, in this paper we consider an inverse module transfer learning framework, where the inverse module of a source robot system is transferred to a target robot system to improve its tracking performance on arbitrary trajectories. We derive a theoretical bound on the tracking error when a source inverse module is transferred to the target robot and propose a Bayesian-optimization-based algorithm to estimate this bound from data. We further highlight the asymmetric nature of cross-robot experience transfer that has often been neglected in the literature. We demonstrate our approach in quadrotor experiments and show that we can guarantee positive transfer on the target robot for tracking random periodic trajectories.},

 abstract = {Multi-agent systems (MASs) can autonomously learn to solve previously unknown tasks by means of each agent's individual intelligence as well as by collaborating and exploiting collective intelligence. This article considers a group of autonomous agents learning to track the same given reference trajectory in a possibly small number of trials. We propose a novel collective learning control method that combines iterative learning control (ILC) with a collective update strategy. We derive conditions for desirable convergence properties of such systems. We show that the proposed method allows the collective to combine the advantages of the agents' individual learning strategies and thereby overcomes trade-offs and limitations of single-agent ILC. This benefit is achieved by designing a heterogeneous collective, i.e., a different learning law is assigned to each agent. All theoretical results are confirmed in simulations and experiments with two-wheeled-inverted-pendulum robots (TWIPRs) that jointly learn to perform the desired maneuver.},

@misc{Wang.24.11.2018,
 abstract = {When labeled data is scarce for a specific target task, transfer learning often offers an effective solution by utilizing data from a related source task. However, when transferring knowledge from a less related source, it may inversely hurt the target performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer. Despite its pervasiveness, negative transfer is usually described in an informal manner, lacking rigorous definition, careful analysis, or systematic treatment. This paper proposes a formal definition of negative transfer and analyzes three important aspects thereof. Stemming from this analysis, a novel technique is proposed to circumvent negative transfer by filtering out unrelated source data. Based on adversarial networks, the technique is highly generic and can be applied to a wide range of transfer learning algorithms. The proposed approach is evaluated on six state-of-the-art deep transfer methods via experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying levels of difficulty. Empirically, the proposed method consistently improves the performance of all baseline methods and largely avoids negative transfer, even when the source data is degenerate.},

@book{Brunton.2019,
 abstract = {Data-driven discovery is revolutionizing the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems. This textbook brings together machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to integrate modeling and control of dynamical systems with modern methods in data science. It highlights many of the recent advances in scientific computing that enable data-driven methods to be applied to a diverse range of complex systems, such as turbulence, the brain, climate, epidemiology, finance, robotics, and autonomy. Aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in the engineering and physical sciences, the text presents a range of topics and methods from introductory to state of the art.},
